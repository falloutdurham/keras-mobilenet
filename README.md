# keras-mobilenet

A very quick and dirty port of the [MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)
 Architecture to Keras 2 (using Jeremy Howard's VGG code as a guide). 

 Currently, no, it doesn't support ⍺ or ⍴ parameters (I'll get around to it, honest!), and instead just creates the base architecture. 

 There's no weights as yet, so you'll have to train from scratch yourself. Like I said, quick and dirty.
